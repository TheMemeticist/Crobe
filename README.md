[Evidence suggests](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1829536) that respiratory aerosols may play a role in the spread of microbes.

 ðŸŒ¡, simulated â˜€, and humidity are all major variables determining the persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols, but that ðŸŒ¡ and simulated sunlight have a strong effect on decay than humidity across the spectrum of circumstances. This can be calculated in a mobile or webapp.

The goal of Crobe is to provide this information to the finger tips of users completely for free. The first stage of development will be for Github hosted free opensource webapp for forecasting the half-life of viral particles in the air based on current weather.
